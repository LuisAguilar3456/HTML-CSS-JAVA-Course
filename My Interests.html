        <h4>Play Soccer</h4>
        <p>I really love everuthing about football soccer, I enjoy a lot playing soccer with friends, watching matches, playing soccer videogames, watching highlights from the mathces, watching the analysis, etc. I enjoy almost every single league, every style of football, any comptetion.</p>
        <p>I'used to play for a <em>third division football team</em> in Mexico, it's name was <b>Potros UAEM</b>. At the beggining I was the striker, but as time went on I was converted to the right wing.</p>
        <p>My fvorite football club is <b>F.C. Barcelona</b> and my favorite player is <b>Lionel Messi</b>. Right now I'm really sad because he couldn't get back to home, but at least we tried it.</p>

        <h4>Hear Music</h4>
        <p>I think that hearing music is one of the things I do the most and the main reason is because I enjoy it. Hearing music makesme feel really comfortable, most of the times it makes me happy unless I hear really sad songs but even though I'm having a bad day or anything is ruing my day, the speakes tun on and I forget everuthing else. </p>
        <p>Rigth now I'm really open minded and I try to give a chance to any gender but I must confess that <em>my favorites are <b>EDM</b>, <b>Regional mexicano</b> and <b>Reggaeton</b></em></p>
        <p>My favorite artists are <b>Alejandro Fernández</b> and <b>The Chainsmokers</b>. I know they're completely different but I love them.</p>
        <p>I think that right now,my favorite song from The Chainsmokers is <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrKA7sKOhws">Self Destruction Mode</a></em></p>
        <p>And my favrite song from Alejnadro is <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElF_NuB3LHc">Si tu supieras</a></em></p>
        <p><b>My Top 3 song from each artist are:</b></p>
