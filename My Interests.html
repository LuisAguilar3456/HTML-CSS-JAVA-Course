        <h4>Play Soccer</h4>
        <p>I really love everuthing about football soccer, I enjoy a lot playing soccer with friends, watching matches, playing soccer videogames, watching highlights from the mathces, watching the analysis, etc. I enjoy almost every single league, every style of football, any comptetion.</p>
        <p>I'used to play for a third division football team in Mexico, it's name was Potros UAEM. At the beggining I was the striker, but as time went on I was converted to the right wing.</p>
        <p>My fvorite football club is F.C. Barcelona and my favorite player is Lionel Messi. Right now I'm really sad because he couldn't get back to home, but at least we tried it.</p>

        <h4>Hear Music</h4>
        <p>I think that hearing music is one of the things I do the most and the main reason is because I enjoy it. Hearing music makesme feel really comfortable, most of the times it makes me happy unless I hear really sad songs but even though I'm having a bad day or anything is ruing my day, the speakes tun on and I forget everuthing else. </p>
        <p>Rigth now I'm really open minded and I try to give a chance to any gender but I must confess that my favorites are EDM, Regional mexicano and Reggaeton</p>
        <p>My favorite artists are Alejandro Fernández and The Chainsmokers. I know they're completely different but I love them.</p>
        <p>I think that right now,my favorite song from The Chainsmokers is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrKA7sKOhws">Self Destruction Mode</a></p>
        <p>And my favrite song from Alejnadro is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElF_NuB3LHc">Si tu supieras</a></p>
